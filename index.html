          <p>This is the second webpage I am making.<br> I asked ChatGPT to give me criteria on what I needed to put in the page.<br> I was over my head immediately, because most of what it told me to put on the page I have not learned yet. <br> This is my landing page to all the other pages I will do in the future. <br> As I make a landing page that will link to my future pages, it feels like a commitment to learning html and not giving up on myself. <br> <strong>Heavy is the hand that types the code.</strong>. </p>
